        <h2>Freshman in Greenville, South Carolina</h2>
        
         <p>I am a freshman at Bob Jones University studying sports management with a minor in coaching. I plan on graduating in three years instead of four. I work at the YMCA helping the sports director with various things such as creating teams for upcoming sports, directing field traffic, or simple maintenance. During the summer I work at an outdoor pool, not far from BJU, as a lifeguard. This summer will be my first time being manager of a pool. This includes more responsibility such as making schedules, going to meetings, and making the HOA happy. :)</p>

         </p> Some of the things that I enjoy doing are playing volleyball, playing with my dog Clementine, and watching Netflix. I played volleyball all four years of high school, and many years before then. My dog is two years old (she has a lot of energy) and some type of doodle. My favorite shows to watch on Netflix are crime shows which consist of NCIS, Criminal Minds, and Blacklist.
