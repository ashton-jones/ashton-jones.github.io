        <h2>Freshman in Greenville, South Carolina</h2>
        
         <p>I am a freshman at Bob Jones University studying sports management with a minor in coaching. I plan on graduating in three years instead of four. I work at the YMCA helping the sports director with various things such as creating teams for upcoming sports, directing field traffic, or simple maintenance. During the summer I work at an outdoor pool, not far from BJU, as a lifeguard. </p>
         <p>
           
         </p> Some of the things that I enjoy doing are playing volleyball, playing with my dog Clementine, and watching Netflix.
